Generating a Nuget package for the ApiHelper
============================================

Hi, and thanks for downloading this solution!
The easiest way to get up and running is to follow these simple steps:

1. Open and build the solution - you need the compiled dll in the ApiHelper project to go into the Nuget package.
2. Browse the .nuget folder and run the batch file CreateNugetPackage.cmd - this will generate a Nuget package in the same folder (Levelnis.Learning.ApiHelper.1.1.1.nupkg)
3. Either upload this directly to Nuget (nuget.org) or create an account at myget.org and upload it there
4. If you want to create your own Nuget server to host the package and you need some helpe with that, fire me over an email to info@levelnis.co.uk and I'll send you some instructions on how to do it

Enjoy!
Simon
